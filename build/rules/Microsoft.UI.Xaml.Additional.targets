    This file contains targets that override behavior in Microsoft.UI.Xaml and
    related packages.

    For example: All XAML needs is a reference to WebView2; it does not need the
    DLL and it does not need for us to copy the WinMD into the output folder. It
    also doesn't require the WebView2 loader since we're not actually using
    WebView2. Therefore, we can get away with *not including the WebView2
    package* and only adding a reference to its winmd.
